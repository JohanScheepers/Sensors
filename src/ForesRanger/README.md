# Forest Ranger

Early detection of forest fire and illegal logging.

For early wildfire and logging detection - the most advanced detection out there.

*   **Embedded AI ultra-early wildfire detection:** Gas and environment condition analytics done on the edge via advanced AI algorithms for early fire detection.
*   **Embedded AI forest activity detection:** Logging and vehicle detection done on the edge via advanced AI algorithms.
*   **Low Power Mesh Network:** Allowing ease of installation of an autonomous and self-containing wireless mesh-network. Sensors act as both sensing node and repeater connecting to the cloud.

## 1. Wildfire Detection
