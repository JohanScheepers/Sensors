# South African Farmer Demographics Report

Research on South African farmer demographics reveals a sharp division between approximately 32,000–40,000 commercial farming units and over 2.46 million agricultural households primarily involved in smallholder and subsistence activities.

## 1. Commercial Farmer Demographics

*   **Number & Output:** About 32,000 commercial farmers exist, with a core group of 12,000 producing 80% of total agricultural output.
*   **Employment:** Commercial agriculture employed roughly 840,407 persons as of June 2024.
*   **Gender:** Nearly 60% of employees in the commercial agricultural industry are men.
*   **Age:** The average age of South African commercial farmers is approximately 62 years, raising concerns about future succession.
*   **Provincial Lead:** The Western Cape is the largest contributor to agricultural sales (19.4% in 2024), salaries, and employment (26.3% of the industry total).

## 2. Smallholder & Subsistence Demographics

*   **Scale:** There are approximately 2.46 million agricultural households in South Africa as of the 2022 Census, a decrease from 2.88 million in 2011.
*   **Main Purpose:** Most (80.7%) produce only for own consumption (subsistence), while 7.7% produce mainly for own consumption with some sales, and only 4.3% produce exclusively for sale.
*   **Race & Gender:** Smallholder farming is predominantly associated with Black African households. Among "emerging" (market-oriented) smallholders, approximately 66% are men with an average age of 58–61 years.
*   **Education:** Over 56% of agricultural household heads have between Grade 1 and Grade 11 education, while 23% have no formal schooling.
*   **Provincial Distribution:** The highest concentrations of agricultural households are in Limpopo (28.7%), Eastern Cape (26.2%), and KwaZulu-Natal (19.2%).

## 3. Language Distribution

While specific cross-tabulated reports for language spoken *exclusively* within agricultural households from the 2024 General Household Survey are still in the microdata phase, distributions can be accurately inferred from the 2022 Census provincial concentrations:

*   **Dominant Tongues:** Over 74% of agricultural households are concentrated in provinces where indigenous languages prevail:
    *   **IsiZulu:** The most spoken language in KwaZulu-Natal (19.2% of agricultural households).
    *   **Sepedi:** The primary language in Limpopo (28.7% of agricultural households).
    *   **IsiXhosa:** The dominant language in the Eastern Cape (26.2% of agricultural households).
*   **Commercial & Business:** Afrikaans and English remain the primary languages of business, administration, and technical instruction in the commercial sector, reflecting the demographics of the Western Cape and Free State.

## 6. Commodity Sectors

South African agriculture is divided into three primary commodity sectors: Animal Products, Horticulture, and Field Crops. In 2024, the total gross value of agricultural production was estimated at R460.2 billion. (**Source:** DALRRD *Economic Review 2023/24*)

### 6.1. Animal Products (43.1% of Gross Value)
This is the largest sector by value, driven primarily by poultry and red meat. (**Source:** DALRRD *Economic Review 2023/24*)

*   **Poultry Meat:** The single largest agricultural contributor (15.7% of total gross value).
*   **Cattle & Calves:** Contributes 10.3% of total gross value. Major production hubs include the Free State (leading producer), Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal.
*   **Other Livestock:** Sheep are predominantly found in the Eastern and Northern Cape, while pigs are concentrated in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng.
*   **Demographics:** Livestock is the most common activity for subsistence households (80.7% of agricultural households), particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.

### 6.2. Horticulture (31.4% of Gross Value)
This sector is the most labor-intensive and export-oriented, generating significant foreign exchange. (**Source:** DALRRD *Economic Review 2023/24*)

*   **Major Crops:** Includes citrus, deciduous fruits (apples, pears, grapes), and vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, onions).
*   **Regional Concentration:**
    *   **Western Cape:** Dominates wine grapes (85% of horticulture sales), apples, and pears.
    *   **Limpopo:** Leads in citrus (with Eastern Cape) and produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's tomatoes.
*   **Employment:** Horticulture is the largest employer in commercial agriculture, accounting for approximately 35.5% of all farm workers.

### 6.3. Field Crops (25.5% of Gross Value)
This sector is vital for food security but is highly susceptible to climate fluctuations, such as the 2024 mid-summer drought. (**Source:** *Financial Mail*, "Drought hits SA crops", 2024)

*   **Maize:** The leading field crop (12.7% of total gross value). The Free State is the top producer.
*   **Sugarcane:** Concentrated almost entirely in KwaZulu-Natal (80% of crop) and Mpumalanga.
*   **Wheat:** South Africa is a net importer, with production mainly in the Western Cape and Free State.
*   **Farmer Profile:** A typical smallholder maize farmer is a 58-year-old male, often relying on social grants if farming on less than 5 hectares.

## 7. Race Distribution

The racial distribution in South African agriculture is characterized by a "dualistic" structure, where a majority of farmers are Black, but the majority of commercial output and freehold land remains under White ownership.

### 7.1. Farmer Population by Race
*   **Total Numbers:** There are significantly more Black farmers in South Africa than White farmers.
*   **Commercial vs. Subsistence:**
    *   **White Farmers:** Predominantly operate in the large-scale commercial sector, numbering approximately 32,000 to 40,000 units.
    *   **Black Farmers:** Primarily involved in subsistence and smallholder farming, with over 2.46 million agricultural households as of the 2022 Census.
*   **Emerging Sector:** Roughly 10% of total commercial agricultural output is currently produced by Black farmers.

**Source:** Statistics South Africa. (2020). *Census of Commercial Agriculture, 2017*.

### 7.2. Agricultural Land Ownership (2024 Estimates)
While exact figures are debated due to the lack of race-coded title deeds, research from the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) and other analysts provide the following distribution:

*   **White Ownership:** Estimated to own approximately 72–74% of freehold agricultural land (roughly 58 million hectares).
*   **Black Ownership:** Directly owns roughly 4–10% of freehold land. However, when including state-owned land, communal land in former homelands, and land transferred through restitution, total Black-held agricultural land is estimated at approximately 25%.
*   **Coloured & Indian Ownership:** Coloured individuals own about 15% of individual freehold land, while Indian individuals own roughly 5%.

### 7.3. Regional Variations
*   **Western Cape:** Historically has a high proportion of Coloured workers and farmers in the horticultural and wine sectors.
*   **Limpopo, Eastern Cape, & KwaZulu-Natal:** These provinces have the highest concentrations of Black agricultural households, primarily engaged in livestock and maize for subsistence.
*   **Northern Cape:** Features the highest percentage of White-owned land (approx. 77% of individual holdings) due to the large size of extensive livestock farms.

**Source:** Statistics South Africa. (2025). *Census 2022: Agricultural Households*.

### 7.4. Farm Labour
*   **Demographics:** The vast majority of the agricultural workforce—over 840,000 employees—is Black African and Coloured.
*   **Role:** While management in large commercial units is often White, the manual labour, packhouse operations, and distribution systems are predominantly Black-operated.
